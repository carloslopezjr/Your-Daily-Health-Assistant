Next steps:

To check if motion is accurate and not a slight motion error:
    - Let the motion signal last for more than x amount of times
        - Theory: if it's a real person, they will be moving frequently which will cause detection a lot of times
    


Have it constantly running during open hours and turn off during closed hours

    - Open hours: 6:00am - 1:00am
        - Have a overwrite feature if needed
    
    - Closed hours: 1:01am - 5:59am
        - Meaning if motion is detected during this time, it won't start the program as it's in closed hours
