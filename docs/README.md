Program takes in voice audio and stores it into local csv file.

Next Steps:

Sensor:
Use sensor to detect when to start program and ask prompts to user.

Microphone:
Have dedicated microphone that can hear user from any position in the restroom.


What-ifs:

    - What if user/person goes through the door multiple times in a short amount of time?

    Possible solution: 

    - Create minimum check-in timer. If it's been x plus minutes since last check in, then activate. If not, let sensor data pass.


    - What if the user's voice can't be detected by the microphone at it's position?

    Possible solution:

    - Put microphone in optimal location


    - What if the user wants to manually activate the program?

    Possible solution:

    - Have dedicated button near device that overides minimum check-in timer and goes through the prompts


    - What if someone other than the user activates the sensor which then the check-in isn't applicable to them?

    Possible solution:

    - Either have prompt that confirms the right user or camera that scans face indirectly
